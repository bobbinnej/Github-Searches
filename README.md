## Behaviour Driven Development


BDD focuses on the expected user experience with the app

As the creator i would like the user to:

1. Visit the Github Search website.
2. The user will be met by a homepage with their profile
3. The user can then navigate to the repositories page and input the username of the github  
    user they want to search for.
4. The expected outcome after clicking search is that the desired users profile and a list of 
   their repositories will be displayed.The user can then click more and they will be taken to the desired github account and get to see more information in regards to the selected repository.
